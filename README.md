**One supervised learning analysis:**
- two or more models,
- two or more scores,
- a tuning of one or more hyperparameters per model,
- a data splitting (if a training/test set split is enough for the global analysis,
- at least one CV or bootstrap must be used),
- interpretation of the model(variable importance).

**One unsupervised analysis:**
- clustering and/or dimension reduction.



*Need to be done:*

- Introduction (why is it useful to analyse this data, already research on?, ...), detailed description of the data
- explanation of the EDA + comment the code ("well explained, enough details, logical, appropriately used, codes are explained")
- Same for models
- try to CV with few models
- Hyperparameters tuning
- Outstanding popularity analysis
- Check if we can improve the accuracy of the binary model
- HTML presentation
- Conclusion : Interpretation and results exploitation
