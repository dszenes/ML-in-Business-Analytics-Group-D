**One supervised learning analysis:**
- two or more models,
- two or more scores,
- a tuning of one or more hyperparameters per model,
- a data splitting (if a training/test set split is enough for the global analysis,
- at least one CV or bootstrap must be used),
- interpretation of the model(variable importance).

**One unsupervised analysis:**
- clustering and/or dimension reduction.

** Extra **
- Implementing variable importance
