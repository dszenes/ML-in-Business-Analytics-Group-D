Current tasks: complete an EDA for this dataset

To do later : - One supervised learning analysis: two or more models, two or more scores, a tuning of one or
                more hyperparameters per model, a data splitting (if a training/test set split is enough for the
                global analysis, at least one CV or bootstrap must be used), interpretation of the model
                (variable importance).
                
              - One unsupervised analysis: clustering and/or dimension reduction.
