### Filtering the raw data set

```{r}
zero_df <- df %>%
  filter(n_tokens_content == 0)
```

```{r}
non_zero_df <- df %>%
  filter(n_tokens_content > 0)
```

```{r}
long_df <- df %>%
  filter(n_tokens_content > 700)
```

```{r}
normal_df <- df %>%
  filter(n_tokens_content < 1500 & n_tokens_content > 0)
```

```{r}
#creating shares popularity classes
share_label <- cut(df$shares, breaks = c(0, 645, 861, 1400, 31300, 53700, 77200, 843300))
levels(share_label) <- c("Very Poor", "Poor", "Average", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent", "Exceptional")

new <- data_frame(df, share_label, )
