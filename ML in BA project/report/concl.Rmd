The aim of this project was to study the predictive power of several algorithms on a dataset allows us to explore the possibilities of predicting the popularity of online content based on information about the content itself. The best algorithm with the best predictive power is a random forest with a with mtry = 2.5. The best algorithm with the best predictive power is a random forest and allows us to have a prediction accuracy of about 65%. On the same algorithm, the literature tends to have a slightly higher score, but uses all the features, which makes us think that there is a risk of overfitting. We have chosen the features that can be generalised to other texts, and that seem to be easier to interpret for a generalised implementation. We also wanted to capture the predictive power of articles with impressive popularity. This has never been done before in the literature. The aim was to predict whether a text we were going to write had the potential to be impressively popular (and therefore could reach a very large number of people and could generate high engagement).
However, we believe that the results we have found and which are also found in the literature are too weak to generalise these algorithms. Or to use them with hindsight.
These algorithms measure popularity with basic intrasubjective information about a text (its length, when it was published, whether the mood of the text refers to a positive aspect, ...). However, we believe that it is too difficult to accurately predict the popularity of a text with this information alone. There is something else in the popularity that is not yet present.
To generalise these algorithms, we think it would be important to push/add more complex information to the dataset
